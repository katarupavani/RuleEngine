# RuleEngine
Overview
This is a simple 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and spend. The system uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.
